        Hi I'm Connor and I'm a graduate web developer looking for work in the
        Cheltenham area. I'm interested in front-end development. When I'm not
        making websites i enjoy watching Liverpool and Exeter Chiefs, or
        listening to music. Check out what I've been listening to below!{" "}
